Tree Locali[sz]ation
====================


In many ways this is the crux of the project.

`forcelocalise.launch` is the main demo. It expects data in `laser_hover/demo/mounted.bag`. The launch delay is currently tuned for the tennis court flight trial.

`play`/`record` are used to do the processing separately to the visualisation, which is handy if you're on a low power machine.

More information is in the report.
