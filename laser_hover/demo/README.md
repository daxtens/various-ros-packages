This contains various general demo files.

* `flying` contains flight data bags.
* `walking` contains walking data bags.

To use the files, copy one of them to `mounted.bag` in this directory (the name is for historical reasons). Then go to one of the packages (`flying` and `tree_fix` are good choices) and run the demos there.

Why the name laser hover? It relates to the changed scope of the project. See the report.
